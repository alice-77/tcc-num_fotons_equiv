abstract = {Here is presented a study of the processes generated by the
	electromagnetic interaction in relativistic nuclear, and atomic collisions.
		There is nowadays a vivid interest in this field due to the
		construction of relativistic heavy ion accelerators. Certainly, the
		most important purpose of these relativistic heavy ion machines is the
		study of nuclear matter under extreme conditions. In central
		nucleus-nucleus collisions one hopes to observe new forms of nuclear
		matter, like the quark-gluon plasma [Lu-84, Bay-86]. On the other hand,
	very strong electromagnetic fields for a very short time are present in
		distant collisions with no nuclear contact. Such fields can also lead
		to interesting effects, which are discussed here. There have been many
		interesting theoretical and experimental developments on this subject,
	and new ares of research were opened. Of special interest is, e.g., the
		case of nuclear fragmentation. This is accomplished through the
		excitation of giant resonances or by direct break-up of the nuclei by
		means of their electromagnetic interaction. It is shown that this
		process can be used to study nuclear structure properties which are n
		not accessible by means of the traditional electromagnetic excitation
		at nonrelativistic energies. The creation of particles is also of
		interest due to the large cross sections, specially in the case of
		electron-positron pair creation. Although one can develop very
		elaborate and complicated calculations to explain the many processes
		originated in this way, the results can be understood in very simple
		terms because of our almost complete comprehension of the
		electromagnetic interaction. For those processes where the
		electromagnetic interaction plays the dominant role this is clearly a
		very useful tool for the investigation of the structures created by the
		strong interaction in the nuclei or hadrons.}

	mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such
		as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc.
		Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We
		give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as
		Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino
		Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors,
	Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that
		are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Machine Learning,
	and one on Spectroscopy of Light Meson Resonances.The Review is divided
		into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 97 review
		articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also
		23 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the
		Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the
